## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a movies dataset to identify key correlations and trends between variables like budget and gross revenue.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Steps

- Imported libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Handled null values (mean for numeric, mode for categorical)  
- Converted data types for accuracy  
- Sorted data by gross revenue ascending  
- Cleaned dates and corrected formatting  
- Visualized budget vs gross revenue with scatter + regression line  
- Created correlation matrix and heatmap for variable relationships  
- Converted categorical data to numeric to deepen correlation analysis

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- Scatter plot with regression between budget and gross revenue  
- Correlation heatmaps showing relationships across variables  

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook (or similar environment for EDA)
