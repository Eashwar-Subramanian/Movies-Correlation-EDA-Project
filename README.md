This repository encapsulates an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on uncovering correlations and patterns within a dataset. The primary goal is to identify relationships between variables and gain insights into the data's features.

Key Project Steps:

1. Library Import:

    ● Imported essential libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to facilitate data manipulation and visualization.

2. Handling Null Values:

    ● Applied statistical methods (mean for numeric variables, mode for object variables) to fill null values until no column  contained any missing data.

3. Data Type Conversion:

    ● Ensured correct data types for each variable to enhance analytical accuracy.

4. Data Sorting and Exploration:

    ● Sorted the data in ascending order based on gross revenue, aiding in a better understanding of the dataset.

5. Cleaning Operations:

    ● Performed necessary cleaning operations, including date formatting and correction.

6. Visualization - Scatter Plot and Regression Analysis:

    ● Utilized Seaborn library to create a scatter plot between budget and gross revenue.

    ● Overlayed a regression line on the plot to discern trends in the data.

7. Correlation Matrix and Heatmap:

    ● Generated a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between variables.

    ● Represented the correlation matrix using a heatmap for visual clarity.

8. Comprehensive Variable Analysis:

    ● Created a new dataframe providing numeric representations of object values for each column.

    ● Obtained a correlation matrix and heatmap to visualize relationships between all variables.

This GitHub repository serves as a detailed record of the EDA process, showcasing the steps taken to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset. It provides a valuable resource for those interested in understanding the correlations and trends within the data.
